# Pusher WebSocket Connection Fix

## Problem
You're experiencing WebSocket connection failures with the error:
```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://ws-eu.pusher.com/app/pk_live_51Rp06mBpmFIwZiSMBP8AYxDhTznhg6vBscxblxthVbk52ilyB4zlnKrC2IcnvVyXF2dv0mvOd2whaTXCZIsEonFo00izEP3DhS?protocol=7&client=js&version=8.4.0&flash=false' failed: Invalid frame header
```

## Root Cause
The issue is that you're using **Stripe publishable keys** instead of **Pusher keys** in your environment variables. Pusher keys should not start with `pk_live_` or `pk_test_` (those are Stripe key prefixes).

## Solution

### 1. Get Your Pusher Credentials
1. Go to [Pusher Dashboard](https://dashboard.pusher.com/)
2. Create a new app or select an existing one
3. Copy the following credentials:
   - **App ID**
   - **Key** (starts with something like `407cb06c423e6c032e9c`)
   - **Secret** (starts with something like `bf769b4fd7a3cf95a803`)
   - **Cluster** (e.g., `eu`, `us2`, `ap1`)

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Create or update your `.env` file with the correct Pusher credentials:

```bash
# Real-time Notifications (Pusher)
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_actual_pusher_app_id
PUSHER_KEY=your_actual_pusher_key
PUSHER_SECRET=your_actual_pusher_secret
PUSHER_CLUSTER=eu
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY=your_actual_pusher_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER=eu
```

**Important**: 
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY` should be the same as `PUSHER_KEY`
- These should NOT be Stripe keys
- Pusher keys are typically shorter and don't start with `pk_live_`

### 3. Restart Your Application
After updating the environment variables, restart your Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## What I Fixed

1. **Added validation** to detect when Stripe keys are used instead of Pusher keys
2. **Improved error handling** in Pusher connections
3. **Added reconnection logic** for better WebSocket stability
4. **Created utility functions** for consistent Pusher client creation
5. **Added connection event logging** to help debug future issues

## Testing the Fix

1. Check your browser console for Pusher connection messages
2. You should see: "Pusher connected successfully" instead of connection errors
3. WebSocket connections should establish without "Invalid frame header" errors

## If Problems Persist

1. **Check your Pusher app settings** in the dashboard
2. **Verify your cluster region** matches your app configuration
3. **Check if your Pusher app is active** and not suspended
4. **Review your app's allowed domains** in Pusher dashboard
5. **Check your firewall/proxy settings** for WebSocket blocking

## Additional Notes

- The `forceTLS: true` option ensures secure WebSocket connections
- `enabledTransports: ['ws', 'wss']` allows both secure and non-secure WebSocket protocols
- `maxReconnectionAttempts: 5` provides automatic reconnection on failures
- All Pusher connections now include proper error handling and logging
