# Schedule & Calendar Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Schedule & Calendar feature for the driver portal as specified in cursor_tasks.md section 10. This provides drivers with comprehensive schedule management capabilities including calendar views, availability windows, and ICS export functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Calendar Views
- **Month View**: Full month calendar with event display
- **Week View**: Detailed weekly schedule with time slots
- **Day View**: Hour-by-hour breakdown of daily activities

- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically identify and highlight scheduling conflicts

### 3. Availability Windows
- **Recurring Availability**: Set regular working hours for specific days
- **Visual Management**: Intuitive interface for adding/editing availability windows
- **Day Selection**: Checkbox interface for selecting recurring days
- **Time Slots**: Set start and end times for each availability window

### 4. ICS Export

- **Event Inclusion**: Includes both jobs and shifts in the export
- **Automatic Download**: Direct download with proper filename

### 5. API Endpoints Created

#### `/api/driver/schedule`
- **GET**: Returns calendar events, conflicts, and summary data
- **Query Parameters**: `view` (month/week/day), `date` (target date)
- **Response**: Events, conflicts, date range, and summary statistics

#### `/api/driver/availability/windows`
- **GET**: Returns current availability windows
- **PUT**: Updates availability windows (replaces all existing ones)

#### `/api/driver/schedule/export`
- **GET**: Exports schedule as ICS file
- **Query Parameters**: `start`, `end` (date range for export)

## Components Created

### 1. Calendar Component (`/components/Calendar/Calendar.tsx`)
- Main calendar display with multiple view modes
- Event rendering with color coding
- Conflict detection and display
- ICS export functionality
- Event detail modals

### 2. AvailabilityWindows Component (`/components/Calendar/AvailabilityWindows.tsx`)
- Management interface for recurring availability
- Add/edit/delete availability windows
- Visual day selection
- Time slot configuration

### 3. CalendarUtils (`/components/Calendar/CalendarUtils.ts`)
- Utility functions for date calculations
- Event filtering and grouping
- Conflict detection algorithms
- Date formatting helpers

## Updated Pages

### Driver Schedule Page (`/driver/schedule/page.tsx`)
- **Tabbed Interface**: Three main sections
  - Calendar View: Full calendar with events
  - Availability Windows: Recurring schedule management
  - Individual Shifts: One-time shift management
- **Location Sharing**: Toggle for location consent
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing shift management

## Data Model Integration

### Existing Models Used
- `DriverShift`: For storing shifts and availability windows
- `Assignment`: For job assignments and upcoming work
- `Booking`: For job details (addresses, times, amounts)

### Calendar Event Structure
```typescript
interface CalendarEvent {
  id: string;
  type: 'job' | 'shift';
  title: string;
  start: Date;
  end: Date;
  pickup?: string;
  dropoff?: string;
  amount?: number;
  status?: string;
  timeSlot?: string;
  isRecurring?: boolean;
  recurringDays?: string[];
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Conflict Detection
- Automatically identifies overlapping events
- Visual warnings for scheduling conflicts
- Detailed conflict information in modal

### 2. Recurring Events
- Support for recurring shifts and availability windows
- Proper handling of recurring day patterns
- Visual distinction between one-time and recurring events

### 3. Responsive Design
- Works on mobile and desktop
- Touch-friendly interface
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes

### 4. Real-time Updates
- Automatic refresh when data changes
- Immediate conflict detection
- Live availability status

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- **React Hooks**: State management for calendar data
- **Chakra UI**: Consistent design system
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting
- **TypeScript**: Type safety throughout

### Backend
- **Prisma**: Database queries and relationships
- **Next.js API Routes**: RESTful endpoints
- **Authentication**: Driver-only access control
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management

## Usage Flow

1. **Driver Access**: Navigate to `/driver/schedule`
2. **Calendar View**: See all upcoming jobs and shifts
3. **Availability Setup**: Configure recurring availability windows
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Address any scheduling conflicts
5. **Export**: Download ICS file for external calendars

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Drag & Drop**: Visual event rescheduling
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for schedule changes
- **Integration**: Connect with external calendar services
- **Analytics**: Schedule optimization suggestions
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile calendar experience

## Testing Status

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ Calendar navigation (month/week/day)
- ✅ Event display and interaction
- ✅ Availability window management
- ✅ ICS export functionality
- ✅ Conflict detection
- ✅ Responsive design

### TypeScript Issues
- ⚠️ Some existing codebase TypeScript errors (unrelated to this implementation)
- ✅ All new schedule-related code is properly typed

## Conclusion

The Schedule & Calendar implementation successfully meets all requirements from cursor_tasks.md section 10:

- ✅ Month/Week/Day calendar views
- ✅ Upcoming jobs with times and addresses
- ✅ Conflict highlighting
- ✅ ICS export functionality
- ✅ Recurring availability windows management

The implementation provides drivers with a comprehensive scheduling tool that integrates seamlessly with the existing driver portal while maintaining the established design patterns and code quality standards.
